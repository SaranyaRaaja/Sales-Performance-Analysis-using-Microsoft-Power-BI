Report 1 - Sales Analysis Insights Report
This report is used to visualize the revenue based on customers, market, zone and its growth over a period of time. We used a year slicer to dynamically analyse the trend. Pie charts are added to notify the revenue by product type and customer type. We used cards to display revenue and sales quantity along with key influencers to find the entities which influenced the changes in revenue. Based on these visuals the sales director team will make decisions in retaining certain customers, increase discounts and product quality.

Report 2 - Profit Margin Analysis Report
In this report,we created various measures to dicover the Profit Margin %, Profit Margin Contribution %, Revenue Contribution % to get insights about which zone, customer or market has highest contribution on the overall revenue. We also compared cureent Revenue with last year Revenue to check the trend and predict the upcoming market growth. A profit target margin was added to provide an alert in the bar graph for particular range of values.
